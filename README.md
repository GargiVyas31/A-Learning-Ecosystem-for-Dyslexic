# A Learning Ecosystem for Dyslexic
**Dyslexia** is a prodigious condition in which an individual has
difficulty in reading and writing but has greater intelligence level.
This is an integrated web application to enhance reading experience
for the dyslexic. <br />

Adaptable reading environment (font, background, font
size), pictograph support and a choice to disintegrate sentences/words to
their corresponding sounds are some features of the application. A major
concern with the dyslexic is their difficulty to accurately understand the
essence of text. This can be augmented by integrating 3D visualizations for
sentences. Thus, in order to provide a wholesome reading experience, the
application includes 3D scene generation from text. Hence, a one-stop solution to overcome learning problems faced by
dyslexics.<br />
